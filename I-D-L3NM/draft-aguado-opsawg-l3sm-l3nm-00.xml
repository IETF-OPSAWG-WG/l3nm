	  <t><xref target="RFC8299">RFC&nbsp;8299</xref> defines a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) YANG data model that
   can be used for communication between customers and network
   operators.  It assumes that there is a monolithic management system
   with full control of transport resources.  This approach (that is
   valid for the customer to network operator conversation) limits the
   usage of the model to the role of a Customer Service Model, according
   to the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC8309">RFC&nbsp;8309</xref>.</t>

   <t>There is a need for a YANG model for use between the entity that
   interacts directly with the customer (service orchestrator) and the
   entity in charge of network orchestration and control which,
   according to <xref target="RFC8309">RFC&nbsp;8309</xref>, can be referred as Service Delivery Model.  In
   some cases, the control of the network is further expanded into per-
   domain control.</t>

   <t>This document uses the L3SM model defined in  <xref target="RFC8299">RFC&nbsp;8299</xref>, and extends it
   to facilitate communication between the service orchestrator and
   transport orchestrator (MSDC), and an MDSC and domain controllers.
   The resulting model is called the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	<t><xref target="RFC8299">RFC&nbsp;8299</xref>  defines a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) YANG data
   model that  can be used for communication between customers and
   network operators.  Although the intention to provide an abstracted
   view of the customer's requested services is clear, the assumption is
   that the model is applied at the top of a monolithic management
   system with full control of transport resources.  That assumption
   substantially limits the usage of the L3SM to the role of a Customer
   Service Model, according to the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC8309">RFC&nbsp;8309</xref>.</t>
   
   
    <t>This document defines a set of extensions of the YANG model described
   in <xref target="RFC8299">RFC&nbsp;8299</xref>  via augmentation.  The augmentations facilitate the use
   the resulting model in communications with the transport
   orchestrator, also known as the MDSC (Multi-Domain Service
   Coordinator) in the terminology of the framework for Abstraction
   and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) defined in RFC 8453 [RFC8453].  The
   MDSC is functional component responsible for orchestration of the
   network resources and instigate connections across the operator's
   networks.</t>

   <t>The data model defined in this document is called the L3VPN Network
   Model (L3NM).  It enables further capabilities, such as resource
   management or to serve as a multi-domain orchestration interface,
   where transport resources must be synchronized.</t>

  <t> This document does not obsolete, but complements, the definitions in
   <xref target="RFC8299">RFC&nbsp;8299</xref>.  It aims to provide a wider scope for the L3SM
   via augmentation, but does not attempt to address all deployment
   cases especially those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported
   through the coordination of different VPNs in different underlying
   networks.  More complex deployment scenarios involving the
   coordination of different VPN instances and different technologies
   to provide end-to-end VPN connectivity is out of scope of this
   document, but is discussed in [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].</t>
   
    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents

<section title=" Yang model extensions">
	<t>The scenarios covered include: the integration of ethernet and encapsulation parameters,
		the extension for transport resources (e.g. RTs and RDs) to be orchestrated from the
		management system, far-end configuration of PEs not managed by the management system
		and the definition for PE identification.


        </t>
		 <section title="Bearer ethernet Encapsulation">
		 <t>The definition of a L3 VPN is commonly defined not only at the IP layer, but also requires to identify parameters at the Ethernet layer, such as encapsulation (e.g. VLAN, QinQ, QinAny, VxLAN, etc). This specification is not supported in [RFC8299], whilst it suggests that any extension on this direction shall be implemented via augmentation of the bearer container.

The extension defined to cope with these parameters uses the connection container inside the site-network-access defined by the the [RFC8466]. This container defines protocol parameters to enable connectivity at Layer 2. In the context of L3SM, the augmentation includes only mandatory parameters for the service configuration, which are mainly related to the interface encapsulation.

Other definitions from L2SM connection container are left aside. For example, LAG information is not required and it shall be configured prior to the service configuration, being the aggregated interface identified in the model as the bearer-reference, as discussed later in Section 4.4.
</t> 
		</section>
		 <section title="Multi-Domain Resource Management">
        <t>The implementation of L3 VPN services which spans across administratively separated domains (i.e. that under the administration of different management systems or controllers) requires some network resources to be synchronised between systems.

Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and synchronised to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the usage of unavailable resources. For example, RTs shall be synchronised between PEs. When every PE is controlled by the same management system, RT allocation can be performed by the system. In cases where the service spans across multiple management systems, this task shall be synchronised and, therefore, the service model must allow this specification. In addition, RDs must be also synchronised to avoid collisions in RD allocation between separated systems. A incorrect allocation might lead into same RD and IP prefixes being exported by different PE routers.
</t>
      </section>
	  	  <section title="Remote Far-End Configuration">
<t>
Depending on the control plane implementation, different network scenarios might require additional information for the L3 VPN service to be configured and active. For example, an L3 VPN Option C service, if no reflection of IPv4 VPN routes is configured via ASBR or route reflector, may require additional configuration (e.g. a new BGP neighbour) to be coordinated between both management systems.

This definition requires for every management system participant on the VPN to receive not just their own sites and site-network-accesses, but also to receive information about external ones, identified as an external site-network-access-type. In addition, this particular site-network-access is augmented to include the loopback address of the far-end (remote/external) PE router.

		  <section title="Provide Edge Identification Point">
    <t>RFC8299 states that The "bearer-reference" parameter is used in 
	cases where the customer has already ordered a network connection to the SP
	apart from the IP VPN site and wants to reuse this connection.
	The string used is an internal reference from the SP and describe the
	already-available connection. Oftenly, a client interface (either a customer one
	or an interface used by the SP) is already in place and connected,
	although it has not being used previously. In some other cases (e.g. for stitching purposes),
	the termination of a VPN service is done over logical terminations within a PE router.</t>
	<t>
    The bearer-reference must serve as a strict unequivocal parameters to identify the connection
	between a PE and a client (CE). This means that, despite the type is maintained as a string and
	there is no restriction in the way this data is formed, the bearer-reference must serve as the
	unique way to identify the PE router and the client interface. This, together with the encapsulation
	augments proposed in 4.1, serves as the way to identify the client interface and configure L2 specific
	parameters.</t>

 <section anchor="design_data_model" title="Design of the data model">
      <t>The augments defined in this document are organised per scenario,
		  as per defined in Section 4. The case described 4.4 does not need
		  any further extension of the data model and only requires a more restricted
		  definition on how the data model is used for PE router and client port identification,
		  so no augment is implemented for this scenario.</t>
		  <t>The augments implemented are distributed as follows.
		  The first augment implements the extensions for RT and RD definition for the L3 VPN,
		  following the YANG definitions from BESS-L3VPN. The second augment copes with the
		  information from a remote PE not directly under the management system supervision. This augment does not follow any previously defined model and includes the loopback
		  IP address of the external router. The last augment includes information below layer 3
		  that is required for the service. In particular, we include information related to clients
		  interface encapsulation and aggregation.</t>
		  <t>The high-level model structure proposed by this document is as shown
   below:</t>
