## L3 VPN Network-Oriented Yang Model

The L3 VPN Service model ([L3SM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8299)) is aimed at being used between the entity that
   interacts directly with the customer (service orchestrator) and the
   entity in charge of network orchestration and control.

   The L3SM model defined in RFC 8299 [RFC8299] is extended it to facilitate communication between the service
   orchestrator and transport orchestrator (MSDC), and an MDSC and
   domain controllers.  The resulting model is called the L3VPN Network
   Model ([L3NM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-aguado-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-00)).
