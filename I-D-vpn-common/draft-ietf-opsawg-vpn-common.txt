1.  Introduction

   Various VPN-related YANG data modules were specified by the IETF
   (e.g., Layer 3 VPN Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299] or Layer 2 VPN
   Service Model (L2SM) [RFC8466]).  Others are also being specified
   (e.g., Layer 3 VPN Network Model (L3NM) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm]
   or Layer 2 VPN Network Model (L2NM) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm]).  These
   modules have data nodes and structures that are present in almost all
   these models or a subset of them.  An example of such data nodes is
   depicted in Figure 1.

         Figure 1: Example of Common Data Nodes in Both L2NM/L3NM

   In order to avoid data nodes duplication and to ease passing data
   among layers (service layer to network layer and vice versa), early
   versions of the L3NM reused many of the data nodes that are defined
   in the L3SM [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, that approach was abandoned
   because that design was interpreted as if the deployment of L3NM
   depends on L3SM, while this is not required.  For example, a Service
   Provider may decide to use the L3NM to build its L3VPN services
   without exposing the L3SM.

   Likewise, early versions of the L2NM reused many of the data nodes
   that are defined in both L2SM and L3NM.  An example of L3NM groupings
   reused in L3NM is shown in Figure 2.  Such data nodes reuse was

   interpreted as if the deployment of the L2NM requires the support of
   the L3NM; which is not required.

                Figure 2: Excerpt from the L2NM YANG Module

   To avoid the issues discussed above, this document defines a common
   YANG module that is meant to be reused by various VPN-related modules
   such as L3NM [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm] and L2NM
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm]: "ietf-vpn-common" (Section 4).

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module includes a set of identities, types, and
   groupings that are meant to be reused by other VPN-related YANG
   modules independently of their layer (e.g., Layer 2, Layer 3) and the
   type of the module (e.g., network model, service model) including
   future revisions (if any) of existing models (e.g., L3SM [RFC8299] or
   L2SM [RFC8466]).

2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG modules is defined in [RFC7950].

   The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

3.  Description of the VPN Common YANG Module

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module defines a set of common VPN-related
   features (e.g., encapsulation features such as [RFC7348], multicast
   [RFC6513], or routing features such as OSPF [RFC4577] or
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880]) and identities
   (e.g., service types
   [RFC4761][RFC4762][RFC8214][RFC7623][RFC7432][RFC8365], VPN signaling
   types [RFC6624][RFC5036] [RFC3931]).

   The module supports a rich set of protocol identifies that can be
   used, e.g., to refer to an underlay transport.  Examples of supported
   protocols are IP-in-IP [RFC2003][RFC2473], GRE
   [RFC1701][RFC1702][RFC7676], MPLS-in-UDP [RFC7510], Generic Network
   Virtualization Encapsulation (GENEVE) [RFC8926], Segment Routing (SR)
   [RFC8660][RFC8663][RFC8754], SR-TE [RFC8426], or Resource ReSerVation
   Protocol (RSVP) with traffic engineering extensions [RFC3209].

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module also contains the following reusable
   VPN-related groupings:

   o  'vpn-description':

         A YANG grouping that provides common administrative VPN
         information such as a name, a textual description, and a
         customer name.

   o  'vpn-profile-cfg':

         A YANG grouping that defines a set of profiles (encryption,
         routing, forwarding, etc.) valid for any Layer 2/3 VPN.  This
         document does not make any assumption about the structure of
         such profiles, but allows to "glue" a VPN service with other
         parameters that can be required locally to provide added value
         features to requesting customers.

         For example, a service provider may provide an external
         connectivity to a VPN customer (e.g., to a private or public
         cloud, Internet).  Such service may involve tweaking filtering
         and NAT rules (e.g., bind a Virtual Routing and Forwarding
         (VRF) interface with a NAT instance as discussed in
         Section 2.10 of [RFC8512]).  These added value features may be
         bound to all or a subset of network accesses.  Some of these
         added value features may be implemented in other nodes than PEs
         (e.g., P node or event a dedicated node that hosts the NAT
         function).

         It is out of the scope of this document to elaborate the
         structure of these profiles.

   o  'status-timestamp':

         A YANG grouping that defines the operational status updates of
         a VPN service component.

   o  'service-status':

         A YANG grouping that defines the administrative and operational
         status of a component.  The grouping can be applied to the
         whole service or an endpoint.

   o  'svc-transport-encapsulation':

         A YANG grouping that defines the type of the underlay transport
         for a VPN service.

   o  'rt-rd':

         A YANG grouping that defines the set of route targets, defined
         as Route targets (RTs) and Route Distinguishers (RDs), to match
         for import and export routes to/from a Virtual Routing and
         Forwarding (VRF).

   o  'vpn-route-targets':

         A YANG grouping that A defines RT import-export rules used in a
         BGP-enabled VPN (e.g., [RFC4364][RFC4664]).

   o  'vpn-components-group':

         A YANG grouping that is used to group VPN nodes, VPN network
         accesses, or sites.  For example, diversity or redundancy
         constraints can be applied on a per group basis.

   o  'placement-constraints':

         A YANG grouping that is used to define the placement
         constraints of a VPN node, VPN network access, or site.

   o  'ports':

         A YANG grouping that defines ranges of source and destination
         port numbers and operators.

   o  'qos-classification-policy':

         classification policies based on various match Layer 3/4

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module defines a set of identities, types, and
   groupings.  These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
   modules.  As such, the module does not expose by itself any data
   nodes which are writable, contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As such,
   there are no additional security issues to be considered relating to
   the "ietf-vpn-common" module.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vpn-common
         Registrant Contact: The IESG.
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

         name: ietf-vpn-common
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vpn-common
         maintained by IANA: N
         prefix: vpn-common
         reference: RFC XXXX
