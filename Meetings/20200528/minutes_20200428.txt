1. Service Types common module discussions: Proposal of groupings/containers/identities subject to be part of these common types to evaluate if it makes sense. issue https://github.com/IETF-OPSAWG-WG/l3nm/issues/110 It is related to https://github.com/IETF-OPSAWG-WG/l3nm/issues/32 
- Oscar presents the common structures used between L3SM, L3NM and L2NM.
- Oscar Presents 1st proposal for common structures. To generate the vpn-types modules. 
- [ITALO]: Reconciliation with the CCAMP and the client SIgnal model and the L2NM is stil pending. Differences/similarities must be arisen.
- In ccamp the types are progressing in paralel with at least one draft
- [Med]: It will not remove complexity creating the common types. But it is good to avoid the dependencies.
- [Med] If we go that path, we could have in addi-tion to types, structures?
- [Med] In L2NM we started with similar structures. It is better not to dumplicate
- [Italo] In ccamp it is common types, but there are also groupings.
- [Med] Even for reviewing the documents, the split is good. 


2.  RT / RD autoasignment https://github.com/IETF-OPSAWG-WG/l3nm/issues/114 and https://github.com/IETF-OPSAWG-WG/l3nm/issues/20 and mailing list dicussions
   
 3. 
 
Oscar Is forwarding profile useful?
Med. Spating forwarding from routing policy is fine.
Med. Having just an id is fine. If we need to add more, we need to be consistent.
Qin. SUPA working group tried to abstract policies but failed. We understand the use cases. The confusion is why is it called "forwarding policy". The
Adrian. Caution about about opening rattle. Have a simple in hook in the module (if someone has implemented a policy module, go there). Just put a hook. Then, tell the working groups working in policies. 
Med: for the extension to ACL, go to Netmod. Or extend it (be specific)
Luis: avoid extending it here. If there is consensus on forwarding and routing, ok, just add the hooks.
3 L2NM discussions


  - L2NM. Basic  EVPN support. Need of expoert reviewer.
[Qin] Will find internally EVPN experts.
