   A brief general description.

   This section provides an implementation report summary for Layer 3
   VPN Network Model.  Layer 3 VPN Network Model is available at:
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-00

   The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype, alpha,
   beta, production, widely used, etc.

   Right now, the data model is still subject to change, therefore it is
   still a Prototype, not put into production yet.

   Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are implemented.

   We have implemented pruned L3NM model with the following parameters
