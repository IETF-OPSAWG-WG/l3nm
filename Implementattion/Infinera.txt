   Infinera has a draft implementation of the IETF L3NM model.  The
   implementation is in beta state and is currently being tested and
   integrated with other suppliers controllers supporting this same
   model.  Infinera is supporting the L3NM model in its Transcend
   Maestro Multi-layer, Multi-domain Controller.

   The Infinera implementation of L3NM covers discovery and
   configuration of IP VPN services, and is supporting both North-Bound
   (server) and South-Bound (client) functionality.  Versions 01 and 02
   of the model are supported.

   The current implementation is proprietary, so under no terms the
   current implementation can be used.
