B.4.  Ribbon-ECI Implementation

   Ribbon-ECI Controller (Muse) has multilayer provisioning abilities
   from the optical layer up to the IP layer.  With respect to ATCN
   hierarchy model, Ribbon-ECI controller can be placed in at the level
   of MDSC and serve as a service orchestrator or at the level of PNC as
   a SDN controller.  Additional information can be found at
   https://www.ecitele.com/muse-network-service-apps/ The L3VPN
   Fulfillment component, which is currently in beta maturity level, is
   designed to support L3SM (RFC8299) for L3VPN service creation and
   activation, is implemented with a data model similar to the L3NM and
   translates it to the device model (ietf-routing-instance and ietf-
   interfaces).

   In addition, the L3VPN Fulfillment component interface include REST
   API with the following methods:

   o  Create service

   o  Edit service

   o  Get service details

   o  Delete service

   o  Notification (registration based)
