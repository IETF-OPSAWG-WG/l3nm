B.1.  Nokia Implementation

   Nokia has a draft implementation of the IETF L3NM model.

   The implementation is a prototype and is currently being planned for
   production.

   Nokia NSP (Network Services Platform) supports integration of
   standard models with the Intent Manager framework.  NSP platform
   provides hot pluggable model definitions and implementations which
   would enable defining models where standardization is in progress or
   non-existent.  With pluggable architecture for model and
   implementation injections, NSP also serves as a Multi-Layer, Multi-
   Domain controller.

   The Nokia implementation of L3NM covers, the following

   a) RESTConf support

   b) Configuration of L3 IP VPN Services.  Create/Get/Query/Delete
   supported on the following operations.

   * Site

   * Site-Bearer

   * VpnService

   * IEProfile

   * VpnNode

   * Site Network Access

   * Site Attachments

   c) Supports translations to the Device Model (Standard /
   Properietary)

   The current implementation is proprietary, so under no terms the
   current implementation can be used.
